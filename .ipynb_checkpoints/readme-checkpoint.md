### Applications
- Search engine results
- Voice Applications
- Number plate recognition
- Dream reader


### How it works
1. lLearning 
    1.1 Clean data (preprocessing)
    1.2 Learning (supervised/ unsupervised)
    1.3 Testing
2. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict.

### Workflow
1. Define objective
2. Prepare the data
3. Collect data
4. Select algorithm
5. Train the model
6. Test the model
7. Predict

## Tools

- Anaconda (utilizes Jupyer Notebooks)

## Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
    1.1 Classification (separate data into distinct classes)
        - Decision Trees
        - Support vector machine
    1.2 Regression (based on previous input data, predicts a continuous output value)
        - Linear regression
        - Polynomial Regression
