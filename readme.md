cd mltutorial
pipenv install
pipenv shell

jupyter lab 
```

### Applications
- Search engine results
- Voice Applications
- Number plate recognition
- Dream reader


### How it works
1. Learning 
    1.1 Clean data (preprocessing)
    1.2 Learning (supervised/ unsupervised)
    1.3 Testing
2. Prediction: Using the trained model to predict.

### Workflow
1. Define objective
2. Prepare the data
3. Collect data
4. Select algorithm
5. Train the model
6. Test the model
7. Predict

## Tools

- Anaconda (utilizes Jupyer Notebooks)

## Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning (learning with labelled input)
    1.1 Classification (separate data into distinct classes)
        - Decision Trees
        - Support vector machine
    1.2 Regression (based on previous input data, predicts a continuous output value)
        - Linear regression
        - Polynomial Regression
2. Unsupervised Learning (learning without labelled input)
    1.1 Clustering (analysing and grouping with does not include pre-labeled class or even a class
    attribute at all)
        - K-means
        - Hierachical Clustering
        - Hidden Markov model.
    1.2 Association (discovers the probability of concurrence of items in collection)
        - Apriori algorithm
        - FP-Growth
3. Reinforcement Learning (involves teaching the machine to think based on its past action reward)
